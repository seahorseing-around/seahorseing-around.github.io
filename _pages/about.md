#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

While it was work that brought the Scout to the city, it's the community that kept him here. Between my Scout Group <a href="https://westsidescouts.org" >12/14th St Lukes</a>, the london Ultimate Frisbee community and surplus bouldering walls there's plenty to keep a outdoorsy person busy!

While my big project this past year has been rennovating my new flat. That's taken up a lot of time but when not sanding, sawing or drilling (or taking a break in a hammock) I also enjoy creating iot projects including a mousetrap, home theatre and a puzzle box.
